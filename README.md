Workstations Network Card upgrade / installation
In the first phase we will cover machines JW380 - JW420. 
 
The installation is straight forward and doesn't require any particular system settings changes. It is also opportunity to label some ports at back of the  PC. Also display ports of the motherboard are to be sealed with a white sticker so users  are not confused where the video cables are to be connected to (a common hardware setup issue)
 
Install the network card in the PCI-E slot leaving one slot gap between. Collect the spare metal slot cover.
(1) Place white sticker across the motherboard display ports
(2) Place yellow dot at the left edge (when looking at the PC from the back) at the height of graphic card slot 
(3) Place red dot at the height of the 2.5gbit network card

 
 
Reconnect the cables + connect the network cable to the new card - assure the pc starts up and functions as expected (mouse / keyboard / displays) including network connectivity.
Discard the packaging. (keep appx 10 cardboard boxes for some further use)

 
The Dell network cards are to be found boxed in the server room (next to the door - to the right) with a few (4?) available on the desk next to Barrie or around.
